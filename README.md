# CoWC
This is the repository for CoWC (Compression of Weighted CNF), an algorithm that compresses weighted CNF based on inverse resolution operators and frequent itemset mining.

## Structure
This repo is structured as follows:

All data (except the source files) for the used datasets is stored in **Data**.

The source files can be found on:

FMA: https://github.com/mdeff/fma

Congressional voting: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/105/congressional+voting+records

Car evaluation :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation

Soybean:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/90/soybean+large

Tic-tac-toe: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/101/tic+tac+toe+endgame

Hayes-roth:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/44/hayes+roth

The algorithm itself is stored in **Src**.

Other used software is stored in **Resources**.

The experiments for the paper are in **Experiments**.

Finally the results generated by these experiments are found in **Results**.
