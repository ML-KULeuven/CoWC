# Cowc
This is the repository for CoWC (Compression of Weighted CNF), an algorithm that compresses weighted CNF based on inverse resolution operators and frequent itemset mining.
## Structure
This repo is structured as follows:
All data (except the source files) for the used datasets is stored in **Data**.
The algorithm itself is stored in **Src**.
Other used software is stored in **Resources**.
